## Note

The MTO-Platform (MToP) has incorporated the relevant algorithm and problems at:

[RVC-MTEA Algorithm](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/blob/master/MTO/Algorithms/Multi-objective%20Multi-task/Competitive%20Multi-task/RVC-MTEA/RVC_MTEA.m)

[CMOMT Benchmark](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/tree/master/MTO/Problems/Multi-objective%20Multi-task/Competitive-CMOMT)

[Competitive MO-SCP](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/blob/master/MTO/Problems/Real-world%20Applications/Multiobjective%20Sensor%20Coverage%20Problem/MOSCP2.m)

[Competitive MO-OPF](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/tree/master/MTO/Problems/Real-world%20Applications/Multiobjective%20Optimal%20Power%20Flow)

MToP provides convenient utility functions. We highly recommend using it for code running. [https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform)
