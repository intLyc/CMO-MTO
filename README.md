## Note

The MTO-Platform (MToP) has incorporated the relevant problem and algorithm at:

[CMOMT Benchmark](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/tree/master/MTO/Problems/)

[RVC-MTEA Algorithm](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/tree/master/MTO/Algorithms/)

[Competitive SCP](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/tree/master/MTO/Problems/)

[Competitive OPF](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/tree/master/MTO/Problems/)

MToP provides convenient utility functions. We highly recommend using it for code running. [https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform)
